## Generating Images
In order to generate a resized image, you will need to go to the [http://localhost:3000/api/images](http://localhost:3000/api/images) url and provide parameters for filename, width, and height.

#### Example: [http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=fjord&width=200&height=200](http://localhost:3000/api/images?filename=fjord&width=200&height=200)

New resized images are saved within the `assets/thumb` folder.\
If an image of the same width and height already exists in the `assets/thumb` folder, it will be returned instead.
#### The current stock images included are:
* `encenadaport.jpg`
* `fjord.jpg`
* `icelandwaterfall.jpg`
* `palmtunnel.jpg`
* `santamonica.jpg`

Feel free to add your own __jpg__ images to the `assets/full` folder!
